| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run watch` | Runs a local web server for development and opens the browser to display it. Automatically compiles styles and scripts whenever a file in `src/` is changed, and live reloads the browser. This is what _must be run_ on the development stage. |
| `npm run build` | Compiles, minifies and optimizes the project. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build. These files are the ones that must be used to deploy on production.                                                                                 |
